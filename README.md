Time boxing is a technique that involves setting a specific amount of time for completing a task or a group of tasks. It involves breaking down your workday into specific intervals, typically ranging from 25 to 90 minutes, during which you focus solely on a single task or project without any distractions. Once the time is up, you take a break and then move on to the next task or project. The purpose of time boxing is to increase productivity, improve focus, and reduce procrastination by creating a sense of urgency and structure around your work. This technique can be particularly helpful for people who struggle with time management or find themselves easily distracted or overwhelmed by their workload.
